# DunnetPredecessor
Recently discovered predecessor to the Dunnet game

Dunnet is the text adventure game that is built-in to the Emacs text editor, which comes with most all operating systems compatible with
the UNIX Operating System.

You can run Dunnet by issueing the command at the shell prompt:
$ emacs -batch -l dunnet

When Ron Schnell wrote Dunnet in Emacs Lisp in 1992, it was based on a text adventure he wrote in MacLisp in 1982.  That text adventure
had been lost in 1984, and he had no reference to it.

In 2017 an archivist at MIT found a backup of Ron's directory at MIT, which included the original text adventure.
As of July 3, 2017, it does not run anywhere.
